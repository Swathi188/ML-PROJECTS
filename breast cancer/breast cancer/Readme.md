# BREAST CANCER PREDICTION
## TYPE : MULTI VARIATE CLASSIFICATION
## AIM
#### In this classification type of problem we will try to predict the breast cancer.Here I have used LogisticRegression by cross validation.

## ATTRIBUTE DESCRIPTION
#### Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and the second highest in terms of mortality rates.Diagnosis of breast cancer is performed when an abnormal lump is found (from self-examination or x-ray) or a tiny speck of calcium is seen (on an x-ray). After a suspicious lump is found, the doctor will conduct a diagnosis to determine whether it is cancerous and, if so, whether it has spread to other parts of the body.
